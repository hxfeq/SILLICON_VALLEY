          Air pollution levels remain dangerously high in many parts of the world.
          New data from the World Health Organization (WHO) released today, shows
          that 9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.
          Updated estimations reveal an alarming death toll of 7 million people
          every year caused by ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution.

          <br><br><strong>“Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalized
          people bear the brunt of the burden,”</strong> says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
          Director-General of WHO. <strong>“It is unacceptable that over 3 billion people
          – most of them women and children – are still breathing deadly smoke
          every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes. If we
          don’t take urgent action on air pollution, we will never come close to
          achieving sustainable development.”</strong>

          7 million deaths every year
          <br><br>WHO estimates that around 7 million people die every year from
          exposure to fine particles in polluted air that penetrate deep into the
          lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart
          disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory
          infections, including pneumonia.

          <br><br>Ambient air pollution alone caused some 4.2 million deaths in 2016,
          while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies
          caused an estimated 3.8 million deaths in the same period.

          <br><br>More than 90% of air pollution-related deaths occur in low- and
          middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, followed by low- and
          middle-income countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region, Europe and
          the Americas.

          <br><br>Around 3 billion people – more than 40% of the world’s population
          – still do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies in their
          homes, the main source of household air pollution. WHO has been monitoring
          household air pollution for more than a decade and, while the rate of access
          to clean fuels and technologies is increasing everywhere, improvements are
          not even keeping pace with population growth in many parts of the world,
          particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
