      <button class="collapsible">How long to decompose waste items</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <strong>Aluminum Cans</strong>
          Every minute, every day, more than 120,000 aluminum cans are recycled
          only in America. But, at the same time, in every three-month period,
          enough aluminum cans are thrown away in America that can rebuild the
          entire American commercial air fleet. Aluminum cans take 80-200 years
          in landfills to get completely decomposed.

          <br><br><strong>Glass</strong>
          Normally, glass is very easy to recycle mainly for the fact that glass
          is made of sand. Simply breaking down the glass and melting it, we can
          produce new glass. But the shocking fact is that if glass is thrown
          away in landfills, it takes million years to decompose. And according
          to some sources, it doesn’t decompose at all.

          <br><br><strong>Paper Waste</strong>
          Based on volume, paper is the largest element in American landfills.
          Normally, it takes two to six weeks in a landfill to get completely
          decomposed. If we recycle paper items, we can easily save a lot of landfill
          space, while reducing the energy and virgin material requirements of making
          non-recycled paper.

          <br><br><strong>Food Waste</strong>
          By weight, food waste is the largest waste item in American landfills.
          The time taken for food waste decomposing depends on the type of food.
          Normally, an orange peel takes 6 months but an apple core or a banana
          peel takes around one month to decompose. An important component of food
          recycling is having the right container to deal with it.
          <ul>

      <button class="collapsible">How to Dispose of Garbage (and Waste) While Camping</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <strong>Food Scraps</strong><br>
          Not all of the food you bring will be eaten. You could accidentally
          drop some, there might be shells or skins you need to remove, or you
          could become full and decide, “Eh, I’m done!”
          <br><br>
          Whatever the case may be, place all of the excess food scraps in a
          sealable plastic bag. Your first thought might be, “It will decompose…”
          <br><br>
          Yes, this is true — but there’s a pretty good chance that an animal
          will get to it before that ever happens. Wild animals can easily get
          sick if they eat something that isn’t a part of their usual diet.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Wrappers & Containers</strong><br>
          The food you eat is going to come packaged in something in order to
          keep it fresh, so this is another type of garbage you need to be
          conscious of. As you did with your food scraps, make sure you have a
          second sealable plastic bag.
          <br><br>
          Not only does most packaging not decompose naturally when it’s left out,
          but it can also be harmful to animals if they attempt to eat it (more so
          than the food that is left behind).
          <br><br>
          <strong>Paper & Cardboard</strong><br>
          If you’re spending the night outside, making a fire is always a smart
          move. A fire will allow you to stay warm while also keeping you out of
          the darkness (so you can keep an eye out for wild animals — and the
          imaginary slasher that isn’t actually there…).
          <br><br>
          Luckily, you can burn any paper and cardboard products you have with
          you in order to start a fire (and to keep it going). Avoid putting any
          other type of material (foil, plastic, etc.) into the fire, as they
          might not burn completely like paper and cardboard do.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Human Waste</strong><br>
          Eventually, you’re going to have to go to the bathroom. We’re not going
          to tell you that you need to urinate in a plastic bag, but know that if
          you do have to pee — make sure you move on from that area immediately.
          The smell of urine can attract wild animals, some of which might not be
          so friendly.
          <br><br>
          When you have to go “Number Two,” there’s a few things you can do:
          <ul>
            <li>Bury it into a hole that’s at least six inches deep and away from
              any water sources. This will prevent it from contaminating a water
              supply or attracting wild animals.</li>
            <li>If you’re in an area like a mountaintop where you can’t dig a hole,
              you may have to smear it. By smearing it, you’ll allow it to be dried
              out by the sun and sterilized by its UV rays.</li>
            <li>If you’re not fond of the smearing technique and cannot bury it,
              use a sealable plastic bag like you would for a dog. This may sound
              crazy to some, but going toe-to-toe with a bear or mountain lion can
              be a lot scarier than carrying a sealed bag of your brownie batter!</li>
          </ul>

      <button class="collapsible">What happens when you DON’T dispose of dangerous waste properly</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          You should never put hazardous household wastes into regular rubbish
          collections, tip it down the sink, toilet or gutters, or bury it in the ground.
          This is what can happen if you don’t use correct disposal methods:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Buried in the garden</strong> – dangerous chemicals and poison can leach
              into the surface or groundwater. This can affect the soil, plants
              and water for a long time.</li>
            <li><strong>Tipped down the sink</strong> – wastes may corrode the pipes or block stormwater
              drains and cause problems at water treatment plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Put into the regular garbage</strong> – this can put the health and safety
              of garbage collection workers at risk. It may also pollute waterways
              and drinking water if sent to normal landfills. Hazardous waste should
              only be stored in specially designed landfills.</li>
            <li><strong>Plastic shopping bags</strong> – these can create an ugly litter problem
              if not recycled or disposed of properly. If these bags get into
              waterways, they may be a threat to wildlife. Most supermarkets
              now collect plastic bags for recycling.</li>
          </ul>
          Illegal disposal, dumping or misuse of wastes is a serious offence and subject to large financial penalties.
        </p>

      <button class="collapsible">How to dispose of hazardous waste</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Always store hazardous wastes properly while waiting for a suitable
          disposal method. There are various schemes in Victoria to recycle and
          dispose of household hazardous waste. For example:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Computers</strong> – materials used to make computer equipment contain valuable
            resources that can be re-used. They also contain hazardous materials
            that could pose a threat to the environment if they are not disposed
            of in a responsible manner. In Victoria, unwanted computer equipment –
            monitors, keyboards, laptops, CD and disc drives – can be recycled through
            the Byteback scheme. Some councils and equipment manufacturers also provide
            a disposal service for unwanted computers and equipment. Contact your local
            council or equipment manufacturer for details.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile phones and phone batteries</strong> – some mobile phones and accessories
            contain heavy metals. Mobile phone retailers, some banks and other retail
            stores will accept used mobile phones for recycling as part of MobileMuster,
            the mobile phone industry recycling program.</li>
            <li><strong>Rechargeable batteries</strong> – batteries can be taken to Detox your home collections
            and some permanent sites or to one of a small number of Batteryback or
            company-owned retail locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Car batteries</strong> – these are collected at many council waste transfer stations,
            landfills and some major battery retailers. Contact your local council.</li>
            <li><strong>Gas cylinders (LPG)</strong> – these include cylinders used for BBQs, patio heaters,
            caravans, camping and lamps. These cylinders can be returned through swap
            programs provided by retailers for replacement, refilling or disposal. Charges
            may apply in some instances.</li>
            <li><strong>Used motor oils</strong> – these can be recycled. There are over 100 motor oil collection
            points at transfer stations across Victoria. You can return a maximum of
            20 litres of motor oil per visit. Contact your local council or use the
            Oil directory.</li>
            <li><strong>Laser and printer inkjet cartridges</strong> – these can be taken to Australia
            Post and Harvey Norman outlets for recycling.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluorescent tubes and compact fluorescent globes (CFLs)</strong> – fluorescent
            lamps and other mercury products, including mercury spills, can be taken
            to Detox your home collections, selected retail outlets and some permanent
            sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Plastic shopping bags</strong> – supermarkets have collection bins for used
            plastic shopping bags for recycling. Plastic shopping bags create an
            ugly litter problem if not recycled or disposed of properly. If these
            bags get into waterways, they may be a threat to wildlife.</li>
            <li><strong>Unused medicines</strong> – take unused pharmaceuticals, including prescription
            and non-prescription drugs, to a pharmacist for disposal through the
            Return of Unwanted Medicines program. Always store unused pharmaceuticals
            out of reach of children before you dispose of them.</li>
